For each index we computed the recursive function considering the strings that start from the first letter up until the i-th one. \n",

    "The program we created by using dynamic programming takes a string and associates it to a list containing for each letter of the string an initial value equal to 1. To update these values, we compare letter by letter each letter of the string, to check which one comes first in alphabetical order.

If the value of the list in position i is \"smaller\" than the value of the list in position j+1, we will update the value of the i-th list to the value of the list in position j+1. When the letter in position j is instead bigger than position i, then we go on without changing anything. Once the for loop is completed, we will have obtained a new \"match\" list, which contains for each i-th letter the length of the max substring which can be obtained by starting from the beginning of the string until the i-th position, skipping the letters greater than the letter in position i.\n",
